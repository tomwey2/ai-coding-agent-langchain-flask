## Contributing Code

### Development Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository on GitHub.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  Create a new **branch** for your feature or bugfix (e.g., `git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`).
4.  **Hack away!** Write your code.
5.  **Test** your changes locally.
6.  **Commit** your changes (see guidelines below).
7.  **Push** to your fork.
8.  Submit a **Pull Request (PR)** to the `master` (`main`) branch of the original repository.

### Writing Quality Code

* Keep your Pull Requests small and focused on a single issue.
* Write clean, readable, and maintainable code.
* Refactor existing code where appropriate, but try to keep the scope of your PR clear.

### Testing

* **Run existing tests** to ensure you haven't broken anything.
* **Add new tests** (unit tests/integration tests) for any new functionality or bug fix.
* PRs without adequate test coverage may be rejected.

### Documentation

* Update the `README.md` if your change affects the installation, usage, or configuration.
* Add **docstrings** to new functions, classes, and modules.
* If you change an API, update the relevant documentation files.

## Styleguides

### Python Styleguide

We follow the standard Python style conventions (PEP 8).

* Use **4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
* Use `snake_case` for function and variable names.
* Use `CamelCase` for class names.

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the **present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
* Use the **imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
* Limit the first line to **72 characters** or less.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.
